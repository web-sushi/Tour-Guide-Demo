          <h2>About Your Guide</h2>
          <p>
            Konnichiwa! I'm Ken, a licensed private tour guide and Tokyo native
            with over 8 years of experience sharing my city with travelers from
            around the world. Born and raised in Tokyo, I've watched this
            incredible city evolve while maintaining its deep cultural roots.
          </p>
          <p>
            My passion is connecting visitors with the authentic Tokyo, the
            hidden temples tucked away in residential neighborhoods, the
            family-run restaurants serving recipes passed down for generations,
            and the local stories that bring each district to life. I speak
            fluent English and Japanese, and I'm certified by the Japan National
            Tourism Organization.
          </p>
          <p>
            What sets my tours apart? Flexibility. Every tour is customized to
            your interests, pace, and curiosity. Whether you're a foodie wanting
            to explore the best ramen shops, a history buff fascinated by
            samurai culture, or someone simply wanting to experience daily life
            in Tokyo, I'll craft an itinerary that feels personal and
            meaningful.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe the best travel experiences happen when you step off the
            beaten path. Let me show you the Tokyo I know and love, the one that
            exists beyond the guidebooks and Instagram posts.

          Don't just take our word for it. Here's what travelers from around the
          world have to say about their Tokyo experiences with us.
        </p>

        <div class="testimonials">
          <blockquote>
            "Ken was absolutely incredible! This was our third trip to Tokyo,
            and he showed us places we never knew existed. His knowledge of
            local history and food culture is impressive, and he's genuinely
            passionate about sharing his city. The Asakusa tour was the
            highlight of our trip. Highly recommend!"
            <span>— Sarah & James, USA</span>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "We had only one day in Tokyo and wanted to make the most of it. Ken
            created a custom tour that perfectly matched our interests in food
            and modern culture. He took us to the best ramen shop we've ever
            tried and showed us hidden spots in Shibuya we never would've found
            on our own. Worth every yen!"
            <span>— Marco & Elena, Italy</span>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "As a solo female traveler, I felt completely safe and comfortable
            with Ken. He's professional, speaks excellent English, and really
            listens to what you want to see. The tour felt more like exploring
            with a friend than a formal guide. I learned so much about Japanese
            culture and traditions. Can't wait to book another tour on my next
            visit!"
            <span>— Rachel, Australia</span>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            "Our family of five (including two teenagers) had an amazing time!
            Ken kept everyone engaged with interesting stories and made sure we
            had plenty of food stops. The kids loved learning about samurai
            history and trying new foods. He was patient, flexible, and adjusted
            the pace perfectly. Best tour guide we've had anywhere!"
